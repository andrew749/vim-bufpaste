# BufPaste
Simply copy an image from your clipboard and paste a markdown
formatted string in a file. Images are placed in a folder called `.images/`

NOTE: This only works for Mac and Windows due to a dependency on getting
clipboard data.

## Install

Dependencies: Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

```
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

BufPaste provides a command `PIB` that will prompt you for a filename for the
image to be created. Make sure you have an image in the buffer.
